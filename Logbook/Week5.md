**Things done**

Made on/off UI switch for tuner and plugged it into the main UI (~20 min)  

Started creating the tuning standard UI element and debugged a bunch of random things on Phone b/c sim isn't good for this part (~1hr)  
Including:  
Correct Spacing around text elements  
Tap to make keyboard go away  
Cursor starting at the end of the text field not the beginning 

Day 2 (~1hr 30 min)  
Qualified user input for tuning standard to a given range [400, 460]  
Realized cursor fix didn't work, realized its a builtin UI element thing, moved on  


Installed homebrew (~20 min)
